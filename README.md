My Game Collection Website 🎮 🙀 🌚
---------
I own a thing at https://o9creeperboi.weebly.com .
Go check it out, our collection is *endless* 😉 <br>
```
Okay to be honest we don't even have 10 games lol. This is because:
1. I make all of the games, so progress is slow
2. All of the games are at LEAST semi-original, so this makes production even slower
3. We are currently not hiring as of now. Sorry!

JoeOS 🧑 🗣 🖥

Are you a fan of Joe Simulator by PuzzlingGGG?? Then you should check this crap out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's still in development, but I am willing to work with others on this heck of a project :D
Conditions:
- I don't have discord so Scratch and GitHub are my main talkie-talkie sites.
- I'm using PenguinMod to develop this stuff, so no Gandi IDE...
- I may need to use C/C++ for some stuff, and I have zero clue how to code in those so yeah.
